# eBayScraper
Simple console app that takes in a URL to a product search on eBay, scrapes the HTML on the page, and returns detailed product information for every result. Will eventually be implemented into a web application. Built with C# via Visual Studio 2017.

Currently you'll need to open the Program.cs file in the ScraperTest2 folder using any IDE and adjust the url variable to any ebay search url of your choosing, then save and run from console.

Will soon add the ability to add your search terms directly in the console and have it return results based on that.

This will eventually be integrated into a web application.
